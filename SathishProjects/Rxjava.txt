RxJava2

Observable : Can Emit Data
Observer : Can Consume Data. -> 3 Main Method : onNext(),onError(),onCompleate()

Schedulers : Between Observable & Observer we have schedulers. Scheduler.io are very important.
Operator : DataStrems can be convert to many form by using operator before observer can receive.
            We have, Debound, Map, etc.,

Observables : There are many observables :
    1. Single Observable --> Single Observer
    2. Compleatable Observable --> CompleatableObserver
    3. MayBy Observable --> MaybeObserver
    4. Flowable Observable --> Observer
    5. Observable --> Observer
    6. Scheduler Observable -->

Refer : BaseObserver.java

Disposable & CompositeDisposable are the interface

Once Observeble & Observer connected the complete connection called Subscription.

Scheduler :

    1. To handle multi threading in RxJava we will be using schedulers.
    2. The scheduler is a kind of thread pool. will be used to emit and observe the data

Type of schedulers :
    1. scheduler.io --> is a scheduler thread pool has limitless threads. Can create n number of threads.
    2. Scheduler.newthread--> Always will create new thread.
    3. Scheduler.single() -->
    4. SCheduler.from(Excecutor) -->
    5. Scheduler.tranpline() --> Based on the number core processers.
