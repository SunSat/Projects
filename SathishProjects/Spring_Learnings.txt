problems you may face when you develop spring application first time

1. DAO Design : when enable @Transactional suddently you get an exception cannot load context[]
	Solution : You need to use interfacce to assign the DAO Manager. 

2. When Enable security : You may see just Http Response 404. 
	The reason would be any of one
	1. Intercept-URL not matched properly
	2. Check produce, consume & Http Method in your controller
	3. Clean Up Tomcat webapp folder
	4. If none match still problem persist put a break point in DelegatingFilterProxy.java Spring Java class in doFilter method and start debug which lead FilterChainProxy --> doFilter method for 13 filters. There will 13 Filters you need to go-through.
	5. Mainly 2 FilterChin you need to look : 1. CsrfFilter.java --> doFilterInternal 2.
	6. the most of the problem with content type we use Ajax or Jquery content type : http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ check. like application/json
	7. Method Type Like : Post,Get etc.
	8. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34782025/http-post-request-with-content-type-application-x-www-form-urlencoded-not-workin/38252762#38252762
	9. CSRF filter need to disable to begin with. Once you complete/setup all the configuration then you can enable CSRF Filter later. Otherwise CSRFFilter siliently throw exception and comming out with 403
	10.

------------------------------------------
3. The DAO layer should have filters from MVC Layer. So that we can load the required data based on the filters.
4. In UI we should use Event-Driven program for login
